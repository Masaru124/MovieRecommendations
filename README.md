# Movie Recommendation System

This project is a Movie Recommendation System built using Python and Streamlit. It recommends movies similar to a selected movie based on content similarity using movie metadata.

## Dataset

The project uses two datasets from TMDb (The Movie Database):
- `tmdb_5000_movies.csv`: Contains movie details such as title, overview, genres, keywords, cast, and crew.
- `tmdb_5000_credits.csv`: Contains credits information including cast and crew details.

## Data Preprocessing and Model Building

- The datasets are merged and relevant features are extracted.
- A combined "tags" feature is created by merging genres, keywords, cast, and crew.
- Text data in "tags" is vectorized using TF-IDF.
- Cosine similarity is computed between movies based on the TF-IDF vectors.
- A similarity matrix is created to find movies similar to a given movie.

These steps are implemented in the Jupyter notebook `movie.ipynb`.

## Movie Recommendation App

The Streamlit app (`recomend.py`) provides a user interface to select a movie and get top 10 recommended movies based on the similarity matrix.

### How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip install streamlit pandas scikit-learn
   ```
3. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```
   streamlit run recomend.py
   ```
4. Use the dropdown to select a movie you like and click "Get Recommendations" to see similar movies.
